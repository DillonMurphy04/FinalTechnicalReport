# Report README

This file provides an overview of the structure and organization of the processes that are used throughout the study described in the report
"An Investigation Into the Effect of Temperature on the Elasticity of Rubber Bands" by Dillon Murphy. It is intended to guide any readers or researchers who
would like to reproduce the study by providing easy access to the data management, analysis, and documentation undergone in the study.

## Sub-Folders

The root folder contains the following sub-folders:
 
 #### 1. Data
 
 The data folder stores the data collected by the researcher. The file contained in the folder is a CSV type and is used throughout the study for the analysis 
 and creation of all plots and tables.
 
 #### 2. Documents
 
 The documents folder contains all written documents related to the study. This includes a document describing in detail all edits made 
 from the initial to the final technical report as well as a document highlighting the changes (red highlights made to the original document show deletions while 
 green highlights show additions made to the final report). Within this folder the project proposal can be found, with in depth steps on reproducing the study (this can also be found in Appendix A in the report). Additionally within the documents folder is a references sub-folder containing all references mentioned 
 in the technical report.
 
 #### 3. Results
 
 The results contain all output generated from the scripts. Specifically, the results folder contains PNGs of the tables and figures that were outputted from 
 the scripts. These results were directly derived from statistical analysis methods undergone in the scripts, which are contained in the "scripts" folder.
 
 #### 4. Scripts
 
 The scripts folder contains all statistical code used for the study and report. Inside the scripts folder is a Quarto file, containing all the code for the analysis
